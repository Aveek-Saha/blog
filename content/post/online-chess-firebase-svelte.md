# Introduction

This is a follow up to my Online-Chess project where I created a chess website using sockets and hosted it on Heroku. However you don't need any prior knowledge of that project to follow along.

In this tutorial you'll learn how to build a basic online Chess platform with multiple rooms with Firebase and Svelte.

## What's wrong with Online-Chess?

At the time I had created the project as a showcase for websockets first and as an actual place to play chess second. However this project has had far more users on the website playing chess than I anticipated and I kept running out of resources for the free Heroku tier. This meant that I got a lot of complaints that the website was inaccessible.

FireChess is another approach to this problem that solves a lot of issues and adds more functionality.
