# Introduction
In this tutorial we'll be deploying a Svelte application to firebase hosting. We'll also be automating the deploy process using GitHub actions so that it deploys every time we push changes to GitHub. 

If you havent checked it out already, read the [first part]() of this series where I set up a Firebase cloud function as a backend for our application. Even if your use case is different and you're only interested in Automating the deploy process to firebase hosting you can still follow along and modify the steps to suit you choice of frontend framework. Alternatively you can also skip ahead to the [Automation]() section.


For those of you not familiar with Svelte, I've already written a beginners guide on Svelte that you can check out [here](). It's fairly easy to learn the basics so be sure to go through that first.

# Frontend

Now that we have our cloud function set up, let's create the frontend from where we can upload the image and get the converted result. For this we'll first need to set up firebase hosting to deploy the frontend.


## Set up Firebase Hosting

1. Check your directory- 
Go to the root directory of your Firebase project.

2. Run Firebase init- 
Once in the root directory, run `firebase init`, it'll tell you that you're already in a firebase project but that's fine, setting up hosting wont affect the function we've just created. When prompted for which features you want to set up, select hosting.

3. Config options- `What do you want to use as your public directory?` `Configure as a single-page app?`, yes 


During the setup, Use an existing project, and select the project you'd created through the console in the step before. Select JavaScript as the language and pick install dependencies using npm when it offers you the option. Once all the dependencies have finished isntalling you're ready for the next step!

## Setup Svelte

Create a svelte application in the Firebase project directory
```bash
npx degit sveltejs/template client
```

change working direcory
isntall dependencies

replace the  public folder created by firebase hosting with the one generated by svelte
change rollup config
change sirv folder
