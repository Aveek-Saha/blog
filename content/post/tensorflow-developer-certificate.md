A brief summary of what materials to study from and a list of free practice tests to prepare for the TensorFlow Developer Certificate Exam.

# Introduction
 
In this guide I'll be going over what the TensorFlow Developer Certificate is, why you might want to give the exam, what you need to study to do well on the test and finally some pointers for when you're giving the test.
 
 
# What is it?
 
The TensorFlow Developer Certificate is an exam that tests your proficiency in solving machine learning and deep learning problems using TensorFlow in python. 
 
This is a coding based exam and the certificate you receive will be valid for 3 years from the date of issue. Apart from the certificate, your name will also be added to the [TensorFlow Certificate Network](https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate-network), where you can see other developers who have cleared the test. You can also search for specific developers from this page, or narrow it down by location.
 
 
# Why should I get this certification?
 
The certification is basically a sign to potential employers or clients that you are able to formulate and solve ML or DL problems with TensorFlow. If you're either looking to get into Artificial intelligence or switch roles to a ML engineer this might be a worthwhile endeavor to pursue.
 
However there are a few things to keep in mind before you decide to pursue this certification. 
- This is a relatively new certification, at the time I'm writing this, and as such it's importance in the industry might not be very high yet.
- It's not cheap. At 100 USD it's fairly expensive and might be inaccessible to a lot of people. There might be more cost effective ways to display your competence in TensorFlow.
- This certification does not test Machine learning and deep learning fundamentals, only your competence in implementing these concepts using TensorFlow.
 
If you're okay with the caveats I've listed above and you want to build your profile, then it's a great certification to have. I personally wrote the exam because I'm always looking for a new challenge and I'm passionate about Machine learning and its applications. Also this one of the only machine learning specific professional certifications around, and if you're going to be using TensorFlow might as well get your certification from the people that created it.
 
# How should I prepare?
 
The TensorFlow Developer Certificate tests your ability to use TensorFlow to solve a subset of machine learning problems. For the extensive list of topics check the [handbook](https://www.tensorflow.org/site-assets/downloads/marketing/cert/TF_Certificate_Candidate_Handbook.pdf)
 
To summarise, there are 4 main topics covered in the exam:
 
1. Tensorflow basics
2. Image classification
3. Natural language processing
4. Time series and sequences
 
Now depending on how familiar you are with Neural networks and deep learning your approach to the test will vary.
 
# 1. Already familiar with deep learning concepts
 
 
# 2. Complete beginner to deep learning
