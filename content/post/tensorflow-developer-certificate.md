A brief summary of what materials to study from and a list of free practice tests to prepare for the TensorFlow Developer Certificate Exam.

# Introduction

In this guide I'll be going over what the TensorFlow Developer Certificate is, why you might want to give the exam, what you need to study to do well on the test and finally some pointers for when you're giving the test.


# What is it?

The TensorFlow Developer Certificate is an exam that tests your proficency in solving machine learning and deep learning problems using TensorFlow in python. 

This is a coding based exam and the certificate you recieve will be valid for 3 years from the date of issue. Apart from the certificate, your name will also be added to the [TensorFlow Certificate Network](https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate-network), where you can see other developers who have cleared the test. You can also search for specific developers from this page, or narrow it down by location.


# Why should I get this certification?

The certification is basically a sign to potential employers or clients that you are able to formulate and solve ML or DL problems with TensorFlow. If you're either looking to get into Artificial intelligence or switch roles to a ML engineer this might be a worthwile endeavor to pursue.

However there are a few things to keep in mind before you decide to pursue this certification. 
- This is a relatively new certification, at the time I'm writing this, and as such it's importance in the industry might not be very high yet.
- It's not cheap. At a 100 USD it's fairly expensive and might be inacessable to a lot of people. There might be more cost effective ways to display your competence in TensoFlow.
- This certification does not test Machine learning and deep learning fundamentals, only your competence in implimenting theseconcepts using TensorFlow.
