I'm a Computer Science student and I am passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, the Web, and Application development. I also work on IoT projects and I'm handy with microcontrollers.<br>
I love swimming and drawing as well. Be sure to check out some of my [`artwork`](https://www.behance.net/aveeks/).
