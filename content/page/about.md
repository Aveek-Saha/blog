I'm a Computer Science Engineering student and I am passionate about Full stack development, Machine Learning and Cloud Computing. I also work on IoT projects and I'm handy with microcontrollers.

I love swimming and drawing as well. Be sure to check out some of my [`artwork`](https://www.behance.net/aveeks/). 


You can find out more about the things I make on my [Portfolio](https://home.aveek.io)
